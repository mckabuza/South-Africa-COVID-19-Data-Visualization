# South-Africa-COVID-19-Data-Visualization

This Notebook intends to visualize the COVID-19 South Africa statistics from publicly available datasets. The first recorded positive case was reported on 5 March 2020 in the province KwaZulu Natal from a patient who had recently arrived from a trip to Italy (https://www.nicd.ac.za/first-case-of-covid-19-coronavirus-reported-in-sa/).  The provincial, age and gender data was obtained from the NICD website: https://www.nicd.ac.za/ and the national data from a Kaggle database: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset

We have also created a Webpage/Github page for a more presentable outlook which can be accessed via:
